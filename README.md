### Hi!

My name is Leonardo Menezes. Since 2025, I have been studying web development and software engineering. I love exploring the inner working of things and interacting with source code and dotfiles.

I have an interest in:

- Optimizing and simplifying complicated tasks.
- Learning from documentation, articles, and with others.
- JavaScript | React.js | Next.js
